This provides the student with ample learning opprotunity.  Unguided projects have a less structured experience more akin to a practical data science exerpeince.

## Introduction
My name is Brandon Khuu and I am an aspiring data scientist.  I have chosen to enroll in DataCamp and complete their courses and projects as my form of eduction for data science, data analytics, data visualization and machine learning.  In this directory, are all the guided and unguided projects that I have completed from DataCamp.  I made use of the various skills they taught in the different courses to complete the projects and each project focuses on a different subset of skills.
